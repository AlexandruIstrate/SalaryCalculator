This is a [Salary Calculator App](https://alexandruistrate.github.io/SalaryCalculator) that allows the user to convert between the cost of living between two countries using the PPP index. Currently, it doesn't use any API data and just converts using a random number multiplier but in the future it will connect to a World Bank API to get the data.
